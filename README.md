# Implementing the A* Algorithm in an Autonomous Snake Game Using Python
This research will focus in the design and implementation of A*star algorithm in a snake game, this algorithm will be the fundamental heuristic for the snake to become autonomous, and can navigate in four different directions in the grid.
